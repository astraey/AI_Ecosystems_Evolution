<h3>The Evolution of Ecosystems through Genetic Algorithms and Neural Networks :ocean:</h3>

<p>The goal of this project is to build an ecosystem simulation platform through genetic algorithms and neural networks. The behaviour of the entities involved depends on a virtualised model of genetic material. This genome model and the genome mixer in charge of generating the new generations of individuals mimics biological evolution.</p>

<p>As this platform is biologically accurate, and the core principles for evolution according to Darwin have been modelled and included into the simulator, It could be a helpful research tool that would help corroborating or discarding evolutionary hypothesis and theories. Some examples would be the evolutionary advantages of a limited lifespan versus a non limited lifespan, or the drivers for a species to become carnivore or herbivore. In the second part of the paper, we delve into some of these theories and through ecosystems simulations, we will confirm some of them and reject others.</p>
